## Getting Started
<Strong>Localization - </Strong>App localization is the process of changing and refining an app in order to appeal to a geographically specific target market.
<br>
App Localization is Pertinent to App Growth
It allows you to increase your reach by not only making your app available to but also more appealing to people in different countries.
<br><br>
<Strong>Language localisation - </Strong>Language localisation is the process of adapting a product's translation to a specific country or region.
<br>It is the second phase of a larger process of product translation and cultural adaptation to account for differences in distinct markets, a process known as internationalisation and localisation.
